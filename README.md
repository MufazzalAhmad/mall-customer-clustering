# Mall Customer Clustering

This project is part of my internship at **Elevvo**, where I worked on clustering customers into meaningful segments using the **Mall Customer Dataset** from Kaggle.  
The analysis was done entirely on **Google Colab** and the final `.ipynb` notebook is uploaded in this repository.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the [Mall Customer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers), which contains the following key columns:
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

## 🔹 What I Did
- **Data Scaling**: Used StandardScaler for accurate distance measurement.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Determined optimal clusters using the **Elbow Method**.
- **DBSCAN**: Explored density-based clustering for alternative segmentation.
- **Visualization**: Created 2D scatter plots for visual interpretation of clusters.
- **Average Spending Analysis**: Compared spending patterns across clusters.

## 📊 Algorithms Used
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

## ▶️ How to Use
1. Open the Colab notebook directly from this repository or download it.
2. If running on Colab:
   - Upload the dataset file from Kaggle.
   - Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
